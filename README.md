# Scrabble_dict

Here is it my simple tool.

Idea taken from Scrabble game.

This code is written in reason to
compare dictionary words to given letters, same
like in Scrabble game. 

# For now, 
I want to create:

1/ Database like SQLite to contain
letters given by user,

2/ Write algorithms which can find 
matching words,

3/ While I will be coding this idea i want practise:
OOP principles, algorithms, clean code principles
